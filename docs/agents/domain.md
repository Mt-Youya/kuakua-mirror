# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- `CONTEXT.md` at the repo root
- `docs/adr/` entries that touch the area being changed

If these files do not exist, proceed silently. The `/domain-modeling` skill creates them lazily when terms or decisions are resolved.

## File structure

This is a single-context repository:

```
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/adr/
└── src/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

Use the terms defined in `CONTEXT.md` in issues, plans and tests. If an ADR conflicts with a proposed change, surface the conflict explicitly rather than silently overriding it.
